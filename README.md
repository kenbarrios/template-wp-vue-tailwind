# template-wp-vue-tailwind
Skeleton for Wordpress theme using Vue and Tailwind

Regularly buiding Wordpress themes that use Vue and Tailwind.
This is just a skeleton to avoid revisiting
- what packages to install
- how to setup the functions.php
- webpack.mix
- tailwind.config, etc.

Nothing else here except a baseline to build out a theme.
